    <h1>My Responses to My Chosen Videos</h1>
    
    <h2>“Don’t Fear the Internet”</h2>
      <h4>Speaker: Russ Maschmeyer</h4>
      <h4>A Link to the video:</h4>
      <p>For this video there were three different parts resulting in three different video links. I have attached a hyperlink to all three below</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href=http://vimeo.com/24006296/>Part One</a></li>
          <li><a href=http://vimeo.com/25665411/>Part Two</a></li>
          <li><a href=http://vimeo.com/27833342/>Part Three</a></li>
        </ul>

      <h4>My Thoughts on the Video:</h4>
        <p>This video was a good recap on everything we have learned so far this year. Russ Maschmeyer explained in the first video what the internet was, how it works, and what HTML is. He explained that HTML is for the content of your website and CSS is for the style. (Which of course we learned in class.)</p> 
	   <p>In Maschmeyer’s second video he talked about browsers. He used the simile that each browser is like different vanilla ice creams. They are a bit different, but pretty much the same thing. He also explained that if you’re are web designer, it is your duty to download every browser and make sure your website looks the same throughout each one.</p>
        <p>In the final video Maschmeyer explains how to use CSS and what it is. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. He showed us how to check out our favorite websites and see what kind of styling each one uses. How we did this was by using the inspect element on Google Chrome. We also learned how to do this in class. Everything he said in the video was a recap on what we have already learned in class, but besides that I thought it was a great refresher!</p>

      <h4>Three Things I learned:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Ted Stevens is the senator of regulating the internet for the entire United States.</li>
          <li>There are two types of websites: 1.Static, 2.Dynamic</li>
          <li>Three types of CSS:1.Inline, 2.Internal, 3.External</li>
        </ul>
  <h2>“Designing With Detail”</h2>
  <h4>Speaker: Dan Saffer</h4>
  <h4>A Link to the video:</h4>
    <a href=http://vimeo.com/album/2784294/video/89543518/>Designing with Detail Link</a>
  <h4>My Thoughts on the Video:</h4>
    <p>I thought this subject matter on the video was interesting. I did not know what micro interactions were before it, but now I do. He used the example of the cell phone ringing during a symphony and the sound it made to remind you of something that you said to remind you about. I really enjoyed this quote in the video: “The difference between a product you love and one you tolerate are often micro interactions you have with it.” After watching this video I realized that micro interactions are the small things, like the like button on Facebook and retweeting someone on twitter. These products would not be the same if they did not have these features. A product can function without micro interactions, but that product will not have a great user experience. Which is an issue, because the user experience is important for having the product last, without engaging the user it will never last more then a year.</p>

  <h4>Three Things I learned:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>I learned that Micro interactions are things that can make a huge difference to overall experiences ex) format, favorite or like, give a rating</li> 
      <li>The product will suffer if there is no micro interaction</li> 
      <li>Micro interactions module: trigger rules -> feedback -> loops and modes</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>2013/4</h2> 
  <h4>Speaker: Brad Frost</h4> 
  <h4>A Link to the video:</h4>  
  <a href="http://vimeo.com/63437853">2013/4 Video Link</a>
  <h4>My Thoughts on the Video:</h4>
    <p>Frost starts out with facts about how technology and the web has changed this earth. Apart from the statistical analysis he offers, what I found most interesting and thought provoking was his take on Bullshit, the normal every day Bullshit that we run into on the web and the annoyances that accompany it.  The websites we go to for information are littered with advertisements and other clutter that we have become so used it we just overlook them and keep reading until we find what we need. It’s that clutter that has the potential to ruin the web, in that it makes websites frustrating to visit. With technology in today’s world, it gets progressively harder to maintain the integrity of art. Anyone is a photographer when they have an Instagram, anyone can be a musician when they have software on their computer. Frost’s greatest point he made was that craft sets professionals apart. Web designers with unique craft will set themselves apart and earn the title professional.</p> 
  <h4>Three things I’ve learned:</h4>
    <p>I found the statistics that Frost presented at the start of his presentation to be extremely interesting. For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>130 million books are in existence and 10% of them were created last year.</li>
	 <li>3.8 trillion photogrpahs exist today and 10% of them were created last year.</li>
      <li>90% of all data ever created was created in the last two years.</li>
    </ul>
      <p>Frost quoted Eric Schmidt saying “There were 5 exhibits of information created between the dawn of civilization through 2003, but that much information is now created every 2 days, and the pace is increasing.” This quote perfectly sums of the technological advancements being made through the web.</p>
